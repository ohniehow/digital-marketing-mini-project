		<h2>Expat Life</h2>
		<p>The population of Dubai is roughly 2 million and rising. The Emirati citizens are in the minority both in Dubai and the UAE as the majority of people are expatriates from all over the world. The UAE is a largely tax free country, which is one of the top reasons why people from all over the world decide to move to UAE and work in Dubai or Abu Dhabi. </p>
